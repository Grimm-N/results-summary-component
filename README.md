## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- SCSS
- JavaScript
- Json fail


### What I learned

Well, let‚Äôs just say I‚Äôve got a pretty solid grip on most things... except maybe animations that look smooth and not like a choppy robot dance. üíÉü§ñ If someone could show me the secret sauce to flawless transitions, that would be awesome. Also, making sure my CSS is clean and not a spaghetti monster would be a dream come true. üçùüé®

And hey, if you‚Äôve got magical debugging skills, I‚Äôm all ears. My console and I are getting a bit too comfortable together. üòÜüîç
